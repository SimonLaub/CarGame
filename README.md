A car game in Python, with help from an LLM.<br>

<style>p{color:blue;}
Work with an LLM to create a car game. Focus on the car game functionality. Notice: Writing clean code is obviously always important. But here you are asked to “play along” with the code you are given by the LLM. And only refactor the code, when you think the code given to you, from the LLM, becomes too “smelly”. You can even ask the LLM to help you with refactoring. </style><br>
