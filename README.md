<br>
So, here we go. We are going to create a car game with the help of an LLM. <br>
Exciting.
<h2>Exercise 1.</h2>
So, we begin chatting with ChatGPT (version ChatGPT o1-preview. October 2024).<br>

<br>
Interestingly, and a little surprisingly, this worked <i><b>fine</b></i> right out of the box.<br>
<br>
Running the code, it looks like this:<br>
<br>

Perhaps not the most exciting car game you ever saw, but a good start.<br>
You can now ask ChatGPT for similar code,<br> or you can run the code  <a href="Code/CargameInitialVersion.py">Car Game</a> (Initial version).<br>
<br>
You can control the car with arrows, and the car does appear to be moving. So, thatâ€™s all fine. <br>
The car is yellow off road, and red on the road. Ok. Fine. <br>
Still, you can, of course, change everything you are not pleased with, or ask ChatGPT to do it for you.

<h2>Exercise 2.</h2>
In order to make the game more exciting, I will ask for a more winding road. <br>
