# Car Game
A car game in Python, with help from an LLM.<br>
<br>
$${\color{blue}Work \space with \space an \space LLM \space to \space create \space a \space car \space game. \space Focus \space on \space the \space car \space game \space functionality. \space Notice: \space Writing \space clean \space code \space is \space obviously \space always \space important. \space But \space here \space you \space are \space asked \space to \space “play \space along” \space with \space the \space code \space you \space are \space given \space by \space the\space \space LLM. \space And \space only \space refactor \space the \space code, \space when \space you \space think \space the \space code \space given \space to \space you, \space from \space the \space LLM, \space becomes \space too \space “smelly”. \space You \space can \space even \space ask \space the \space LLM \space to \space help \space you  \space with \space refactoring.}$$
